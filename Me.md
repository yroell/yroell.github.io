I am working on my PhD in the [Department of Agroecology](http://agro.au.dk/en/) at [Aarhus University](http://www.au.dk/en/). My research will be under [Mogens H. Greve](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mogens-humlekrog-greve(05546eb7-e25b-47e7-b866-0ea88c4b09c7).html). I finished my Biology Master's degree in 2017 at the [University of Idaho](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology) and received a GIS certificate through the Geography Department. My Master's research was in the [Parent lab](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/parentlab/Parent_lab/Parent_lab___Home.html). Please check out my website for more information on what I do and links that I find helpful for my research.
