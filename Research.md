My proposed efforts is linking morphological and physiological changes with environmental variation which would allow for the understanding of why an adaptation would arise and why a lineage has diversified. My research so far has been correlating the relationship of metabolic rate to shell morphology and environmental differences in endemic land snails of the Galapagos Islands.
