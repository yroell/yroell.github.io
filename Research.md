The goal of my Master's thesis was to understand how variation in habitat can promote species richness and trait diversity. The first objective of this project is to link how island ontogeny shapes the number of species found on islands. The second objective is to quantify the association between habitat features and variation in morphology and physiology of species. I am interested in using GIS techniques in biology to help with management decisions in conservation.

**Species Richness**

By using the data available at the Charles Darwin Foundation Datazone, I can test the topographic complexity assumptions that are made in the General Dynamic Model (GDM) of Oceanic Island Biogeography. The assumption is that topographic complexity will follow a hump-shaped curve through an island's ontogeny. I am testing to see if this assumption is true in the Galapagos and if topographic complexity is incorporated into the model, which measure of complexity should be used. Since there are many different ways to measure topographic complexity, I want to know if there is a single measure that should be used to model all taxonomic groups in the Galapagos or if each taxonomic group has a different measure depending on how each group interacts with the landscape.

**Trait Diversity**

To understand how trait diversity is linked to the habitat where species are found, a well-studied adaptive radiation of the Galapagos islands will be used. The endemic land snails of the genus *Naesiotus* represent the most species rich adaptive radiation of the Galapagos islands with over 60 species currently described. *Naesiotus* inhabits most islands in the Galapagos from lower elevations that are hot and arid to higher elevations that are cool and humid. Along this environmental gradient, these species exhibit diverse shell sizes and shapes. Although work in this system using phylogenetically-controlled analyses has identified a strong link between shell morphology and ecology, a thorough study of physiological variation within and among species is needed to identify the proximate mechanisms and ultimate causes responsible for ecological diversification. I am linking morphological and physiological changes with environmental variation which will help in understanding why an adaptation would arise and why a lineage has diversified.
