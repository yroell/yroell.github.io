**Endemic Land Snails of the Galapagos Islands**

My proposed efforts is linking morphological and physiological changes with environmental variation which would allow for the understanding of why an adaptation would arise and why a lineage has diversified. My research so far has been correlating the relationship of metabolic rate to shell morphology and environmental differences in endemic land snails of the Galapagos Islands.

*Disclaimer: I know the photos presented are not of snails but it is too hard to take photos of snails. This page has some of my favorite animal photos and a video I made on the cool things I saw while in the Galapagos.
