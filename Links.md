**Snail Links**

The first three websites can give some background information on snails. 

[The Living World of Molluscs](http://molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html)

[Snail World](http://www.snail-world.com/)

[All About Snails for Kids](http://www.kiddyhouse.com/Snails/)

The next website has tons of information on the snails I study with references to great papers and a comprehensive list of species.
