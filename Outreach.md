Outreach is both necessary and rewarding. I am always looking for more outreach opportunities, especially to help kids.

I spent 6 months in Fiji on a conservation project. One of the main goals of this project was to inform the local communities what they could do to help. What better way to help than teach in schools. The topics we taught ranged from shark conservation to composting. The first term, I taught grade 4. We would have interactive lessons in the classroom and educational games outside. The hardest part about this was the language barrier but most rewarding when this obstacle was overcome. The second term, I taught grade 8, the true leaders of this school. The most remarkable task they had was lining the other classes up after lunch and holding an oral hygiene session. They would all brush their teeth and grade 8 would monitor and keep a rhythm going for the other kids to brush to. My favorite part of any day was brushing my teeth with the other kids. I soon realized that most of the kids had really old toothbrushes and nearly no tooth paste. I quickly contacted Colgate and received 200 toothbrushes for each student. What a rewarding experience to see the kids light up as they each got a new toothbrush.
